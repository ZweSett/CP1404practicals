1.Reflecting on the estimates made for practical tasks, my accuracy steadily improved throughout the course of the subject. Initially, there was a learning curve in understanding the intricacies of each task, but as I gained more experience, my ability to provide accurate estimates became more refined. The process of continuous improvement not only enhanced my estimation skills but also underscored the importance of learning from practical experiences.

2.Engaging in both sides of code reviews, as the reviewer and the one being reviewed, has been an invaluable learning experience. From receiving feedback, I've learned to appreciate the diverse perspectives that contribute to a more robust codebase. On the flip side, conducting reviews has taught me the significance of constructive criticism and the impact it can have on fostering a collaborative and growth-oriented development environment. It's a two-way street that emphasizes the importance of humility, communication, and collective learning.

3.Looking at the practical tasks as a whole, there's an opportunity for improvement in terms of providing more detailed and real-world scenarios. This would better prepare participants for challenges they might face in professional settings. Additionally, incorporating more collaborative elements into the tasks could enhance teamwork skills, as real-world projects often involve multiple contributors. If given the chance to oversee the subject, I would aim to strike a balance between theoretical understanding and practical application, ensuring a more holistic and industry-relevant learning experience.
